# Concurrency

Thread state
1. executing
2. runable
3. waiting

1 core

context switching 
    -> expensive
    -> save state
    
multi core

have caching system
    L1, L2, L3
    
Best thread pool number depend!
    ex. the best is 3
    4 slower => context switching
    2 slower => not eff

GO scheduler => run time

kernel mode
user mode

Go -> keep thread busy
Process already pool

No need thread
but need
-> Sync
-> Orchestration

5 Kids
go routine -> add more kid
